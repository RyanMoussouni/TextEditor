# TextEditor
Simple text editor

### Description

This application is a text editor, fully written in JAVA. 

It has the following features:
- open / save a file
- undo / redo
- search / replace

A string matcher is implemented on the backend, but you're free to implement more effective ones (KMP for instance)

### How to use it
Download the source code, build the app, and you're good to go!


### Notes
To ensure the app is reliable, the main frame is not resizable for now. It is part of a future release.
