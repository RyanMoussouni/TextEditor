## Description

This application is a text editor, fully written in JAVA. 

It has the following features:
- open a file
- save a file
- undo
- redo
- search
- replace

### String Matcher
One of the goals of this project was try out a few string matching algorithm for the search and replace features. For now, only a BF string matcher is implemented, KMP is part of a feature release.

### Swing rooted tree traversal
I implemented a convenient way to query the component tree for a certain component.

## How to use it
Download the source code, build the app, and you're good to go!


## Notes
To ensure the app is reliable, the main frame is not resizable for now. It is part of a future release.
